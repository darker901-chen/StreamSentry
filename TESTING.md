# TESTING.md — Manual Test Log

Per CLAUDE.md (Workflow), every feature lands with a manual test note here.
Automated evidence lives in `reports/`; this file records what a human must
verify inside OBS Studio and whether it has actually been done.

## M0 — 2026-07-05 — Skeleton pass-through filter

### What was built
- Video filter "obsplugin" (source id `obsplugin_filter`), built from
  obs-plugintemplate.
- Pass-through only: the render callback calls
  `obs_source_skip_video_filter()`; nothing is drawn.
- Exactly one property: "Enable" checkbox, default checked.
- No detection, no masking, no fail-closed rendering — all of that is M1+.

### Automated evidence
Sources: `reports/M0-verifier.md` (VERDICT: VERIFIED) and
`reports/M0-spec-guardian.md` (RESULT: PASS), both 2026-07-05.
- Build green: `cmake --build --preset windows-x64-local` exited 0 with zero
  warnings; `build_x64/RelWithDebInfo/obsplugin.dll` produced.
- Import table is libobs-only: `obs.dll` plus VCRUNTIME /
  api-ms-win-crt* / KERNEL32. No Qt, no third-party DLLs.
- `obs_module_load` is exported (standard 7-export OBS module ABI).
- SHA256 of the built DLL and of `data/locale/en-US.ini` match the deployed
  copies under `D:\software\obs\obs-studio`.

### Manual acceptance procedure — STATUS: PENDING
Nobody has run this yet. M0 is not complete until a human performs it.

1. Start OBS Studio: `D:\software\obs\obs-studio\bin\64bit\obs64.exe`.
2. Right-click any video source (e.g. Display Capture) → Filters → under
   "Effect Filters" press "+" → an entry named "obsplugin" must appear;
   add it.
3. The filter's properties must show exactly one checkbox, "Enable"
   (default checked), and the video must look completely unchanged
   (pass-through).
4. Open the newest log in `%APPDATA%\obs-studio\logs\`: it must contain
   `[obsplugin] plugin loaded successfully (version 0.1.0)`, and
   `obsplugin.dll` must be listed under "Loaded Modules".

M0 completion definition: the human has seen the filter in OBS's filter list.

### Not applicable at M0
The manual in-OBS test matrix from SPEC.md (toast masking, blocklist windows,
password-field guard, fail-closed blackout) covers behavior that does not
exist yet; it applies from M1 onward.
